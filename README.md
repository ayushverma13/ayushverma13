|:---------:|:----------------------------------:|
| -- | Worked on implementation of two basic attacks namely Black Hole attack and DoS were being simulated using QualNet and their impact on the network services was analysed under different scenarios. |
| | |
| Black hole attack | In the Black Hole attack, the malicious node absorbs all the incoming traffic not intended for it. As a result of which, the node does not route or forward the messages intended for other nodes in the network. This attack has a considerable effect on various Quality of Service parameters like throughput, number of packets received, delay etc. |
| DoS by Hello Flooding attack | Denial of Service (DoS) is a class of attack wherein the objective of the attack is to make network resources unavailable to its intended users. One of the most common way to perform this attack is to flood the network with unsolicited, overwhelming flux of packets, thereby saturating the bandwidth and depleting the target system resource |
| | |
| -- | To understand the impact of these attacks on various parameters like throughput, packets dropped, end to end delay etc.  |
| -- | A generic WSN model was created in QualNet and necessary changes made in the code library to simulate the attacks, a simulation study in QualNet comprises of the following phases. |
