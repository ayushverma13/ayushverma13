| Role/Position | Solution Delivery Analyst for the Securitization group (Securitization is the procedure where an issuer designs a marketable¬†financial instrument¬†by merging or pooling various financial assets into one group. The issuer then sells this group of repackaged assets to investors. Securitization offers opportunities for investors and frees up capital for originators, both of which promote¬†liquidity¬†in the marketplace.) | 
| Impact | The solution developed helped Deloitte prove to the client our capability to complete enormous amounts of work in a timely manner giving Deloitte the ability reduce the processing. time from multippl weeks to a day.|

| Tools | Task |
| Selenium, MySQL, Python |  Developing scripts for web scraping information from public websites with validations, and structuring the unstructured data that was uploaded and needed to be stored in databases |
| Python, XML, ElementTree, openpyxl, pandas, numpy  | Creating algorithms for extracting information from a series of excel and word files based on the primary input file using a k-ary tree algorithm, with files as nodes, i dentifying leaf nodes on the basis of certain operations, and transform the extracted data. |
| Python, UIPath | Created 3 Automation that were designed to move the asset data provided by the issuer in the Deloitte modeling tool, run reports in the model, and to pull out data from the offering circular to be compared to the data generated by the Deloitte modeling tool, along with generating a report of all the validations performed in the process. |




# Gem Technologies
| Gem Technologies | Period of work (06/2020 - 11/2020) |
|:---------:|:----------------------------------:|
| Role/Position | Intern Software Developer |
| Impact | Independently built a web based Process management tool, using AppScript on google suite linked to a flask microservice for prescriptive reports through Time series forecasting, along with a inventory management bot that helped in analysing the ideal inventory that needed to be maintained based on the order seasonality and raw material volatility .This solution helped in automating certain aspects of operation , and tracking of performance of departments within the factory like dispatches and production, and help highlight the painpoints and areas of delay in the lifecycle of a purchase order. |
| | |
| Tools | Task |
| Tools | Researched on various Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning algorithms( Policy and Value Iteration, Gradient Temporal Difference, Deep Q-Network, Least-Squares Policy Iteration, Policy Gradient, Backward Induction) for the Markov Decision Process created for an inventory management agent. implemented techniques balancing exploration and exploitation through various Multi-Armed Bandits techniques like Information State-Space algorithms, Thompson Sampling, Upper Confidence Bounds, and Gradient Bandits. Used a poisson distribution for the ordering policy with monthly sales forecasts as its lambda parameter ; the state space defined by these forecasted timeseries and raw material prices from LME; and monthly rewards as the negative of a dynamic stock holding and shortage of inventory costs.  |
| Appscript, and Google Sheets, Forms,  Drive, and Gmail | Built a web based Purchase order tracking tool, using AppScript on google suite for tracking its location in the pipeline from various stages in production, testing, logistics, accounts department.Linked this tool an analytics deck deployed through a Flask microservice for prescriptive report generation and Time series forecasting on sales data and payment cycles.This report helped in employee performance tracking and incentivising tasks based on scores recieved, eventually improving efficiency and reducing delays by 23% per month. |
